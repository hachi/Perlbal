Perlbal supports the concept of reproxying.  Basically, this gives it the
ability to ask a backend node for a file and get back a specific header
that says "this file is really over there, get it there."  Perlbal will
then load that file or URL and send it to the user transparently, without
them ever knowing that they got reproxied to another location.

Add the following line to your perlbal.conf to enable reproxying on a per
service basis ( reproxying is disabled by default in >= 1.38 ):

  SET enable_reproxy  = true

This can be useful for having URLs that get mapped to files on disk without
giving users enough information to map out your directory structure.  For
example, you can create a file structure such as:

/home/pics/$userid/$pic

Then you can have URLs such as:

http://foo.com/mysite/users/$userid/picture/$pic

When this URL gets passed to the backend web node, it could return a simple
response that includes this header:

X-REPROXY-FILE: /home/pics/$userid/$pic

Perlbal will then use asynchronous IO to send the file to the user without
slowing down Perlbal at all.

This support also extends to URLs that can be located anywhere Perlbal has
access to.  It's the same syntax, nearly:

X-REPROXY-URL: http://foo.com:80/resource.html

You can also specify multiple URLs:

X-REPROXY-URL: http://foo.com:80/resource.html http://baz.com:8080/res.htm

Just specify any number of space separated URLs.  Perlbal will request them
one by one until one returns a response code of 200.  At that point Perlbal
will proxy the response back to the user just like normal.

Note that the user's headers are NOT passed through to the web server.  To
the target server, it looks simply like Perlbal is requesting the resource
for itself.  This behavior may change at some point.

One final note: the server that returns the reproxy header can also return
a X-REPROXY-EXPECTED-SIZE header.  If present, Perlbal will consider
a reproxy a failure if the file returned by the target system is of a
different size than what the expected size header says.  On failure,
Perlbal tries the next URI in the list.  If it's a file being reproxied, a
404 is returned if the file size is different.
